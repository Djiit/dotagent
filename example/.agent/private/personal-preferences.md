## Personal Coding Preferences

These are my personal preferences that should not be shared with the team:

1. Use TODO comments with my initials: `// TODO(JL): Fix this`
2. Prefer longer descriptive variable names over short ones
3. Always add a blank line after opening braces
4. Use emoji in commit messages for personal projects
